Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because people might also be contributors to the project and might push code which is unworkable or intricate and I want to keep my work as I pushed it to GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other people's repository on GitHub. Cloning is theprocess of downloading repositories from Github to one's local device. Branches
are commit paths which are created outside of the master or original branch. Forks are used to get other people's repo's on Github,
clones are used to download or pull works from the Github servers while branches are used to create paths for other instances of new features in code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps one work on the most recent commit available for said project.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
After understanding Git and GtHub, I can see no other easier and flawless approach which will solve the problem of collaboration. Life surely would be harder without Git and Github.
